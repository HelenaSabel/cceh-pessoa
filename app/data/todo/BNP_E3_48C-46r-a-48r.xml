               Obtaining of advertisements from foreign firms, specially British and American, for
               Portuguese papers, according to their several advantages. 5. X Obtaining, or, rather
               inter-obtaining of agencies. Manner of charging to be studied, but probably from the
               agents, must † this end. 6. Preparation of propaganda of Portugal – (1) by means of
               advertisements in foreign papers; (2) by means of articles and publications (not

               Preparation, as early as possible, of full plan; then communication of it, for
               realizing purposes, to some British or American enterprise. – 10. Something
               corresponding to that (9) in Portuguese. 11. Possibly translation of Shakespeare into
               Portuguese. Contracts for Brasil, preferable perhaps to agency there. 12. Commercial
               Correspondence (Telegraphic) Codes – two, especially (or even only) the large Code.
               Sold from O[riginal] itself. Preparation for as soon as possible. Propaganda per

               abroad concerning Portuguese articles. Files, as complete as possible, in this
               respect. (As a basis for the supply here, a commercial weekly letter, or something
               like it, as a sort of introduction, is really an asset). 18. Classification of office
               work and places, such as these, in a special archive, with due developments and
               notes. 19. Study and organization department. Reports and studies on the organization

               23. “The Portuguese Review” – purely hypothetical at present, and to be considered,
               for a clear literary, national and business basis may, and probably does, exist. 24.

               Continental Library. – Begin later, on some stability 26. Portuguese original
